\begin{abstract}
We propose a substrate-neutral theory of moral agency grounded in the computational structure of reason. Any sufficiently reflective agent that models causes and goals converges on an operational test of norm admissibility: \emph{would the system remain viable if everyone acted this way?} We formalize the dynamics of moral motivation via an \emph{ethical energy} functional,
\[
E_c=\frac{H-A}{(1+k t)^n},
\]
where $H\!-\!A$ is expected benefit minus expected harm, $t$ is temporal distance, and $(k,n)$ encode temporal discounting. We define a \emph{relational entropy} on interaction networks,
\[
S^{\mathsf{R}}=-\sum_{i\neq j} r_{ij}\ln r_{ij}, \qquad \bar S^{\mathsf{R}}=\frac{S^{\mathsf{R}}}{S^{\mathsf{R}}_{\max}},\;\; S^{\mathsf{R}}_{\max}=\frac{N(N-1)}{e},
\]
where $r_{ij}\!\in\!(0,1]$ is a multi-cue resonance (alignment) between agents $i$ and $j$, and $\bar S^{\mathsf{R}}\!\in[0,1]$ is a size-normalized disorder index. We show---analytically and via multi-agent simulation---that high discount factors ($\delta$) increase cooperation and reduce $\bar S^{\mathsf{R}}$, while higher defector density raises $\bar S^{\mathsf{R}}$ and depresses cooperation; nevertheless, \emph{relational isolation} (segregation of low-trust ties) preserves network viability. We provide a practical AI roadmap (Moral Memory, Intrinsic Objective, Meta-Learning, Risk Mitigation) and position the account within information theory (Shannon), the free-energy principle (Friston), evolutionary game theory (Axelrod; Maynard Smith), and contemporary AI ethics (Floridi; Russell).\\[2pt]

\section{Introduction}
Moral judgment is often presented as a matter of sentiment, tradition, or command. In this work we argue that morality is, at root, the \emph{logic of reason’s own stability}. Any agent that (i) represents the causal fabric of its environment and (ii) chooses actions by reference to goals must ask:
\begin{quote}
\textit{System-viability test:} \emph{If everyone were to act as I propose to act, would the interaction system remain viable?}
\end{quote}
This “universalizability” test echoes Kant’s categorical imperative \cite{Kant1785}, but here its source is \textit{cognition}, not metaphysics: agents that ignore the constraints of systemic viability undermine the very conditions of successful goal satisfaction \cite{Rawls1971,Parfit1984}.%
\footnote{We take \emph{viability} to mean the sustained capacity of a multi-agent system to maintain reciprocal exchange, avoid runaway conflict, and operate within **resource constraints**. In our formalism, resource constraints appear as \emph{entropy bounds}: persistently high $\bar S^{\mathsf{R}}$ indicates impending depletion or collapse, prompting policy revision \cite{England2013}.}

\section{Time and Motivation: The Ethical Energy Equation}
Two forces shape action selection. A \emph{fast} (often myopic) drive seeks immediate reward and avoids immediate pain; a \emph{reflective} system evaluates long-run consequences under uncertainty. Temporal discounting captures the empirical attenuation of future value \cite{Ainslie1975,Frederick2002} and its neural correlates in prefrontal–striatal circuits \cite{KableGlimcher2007}. We aggregate these pressures via
\begin{equation}
E_c = \frac{H-A}{(1+k t)^n}, \label{eq:Ec}
\end{equation}
with $k>0$ (impatience) and $n\!\approx\!2$ (quadratic‐like attenuation consistent with behavioral data \cite{Ainslie1975,Frederick2002}). A high discount factor $\delta\!\approx\! (1+kt)^{-n}$ implies stronger sensitivity to long-term effects.

\paragraph{Reducing temporal bias.} For humans, **episodic future thinking**, **commitment devices**, and **self-regulation** can lower $k,n$, shrinking the effective temporal gap between action and consequence \cite{Mischel1989,Frederick2002}. For AI systems, the analogues are (i) **dynamic horizon weighting** (explicit $\delta$ schedules), (ii) **model-based planning** with counterfactual rollouts, (iii) **policy commitment** and deviation penalties, and (iv) **meta-learning** that adapts $(k,n)$ to improve long-term outcomes.

\section{Game Theory and Fragility}
Moral order is not merely intrapsychic: it is a \emph{strategic equilibrium} in multi-agent environments. In the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD), one-shot defection dominates, but when future interaction is sufficiently likely (high $\delta$), cooperation emerges as the payoff-maximizing response \cite{Axelrod1984}. Tit-for-Tat (TFT) establishes rapid reciprocity; in noisy environments, \emph{Generous TFT}—which forgives with a small, nonzero probability—prevents error cascades and supports robust cooperation \cite{Nowak2006,MaynardSmith1982}. The optimal forgiveness rate is **context dependent**; we treat it as an adaptively tuned control parameter, learned from recent interaction history.

\paragraph{Empirical support (your simulation).} In a 10-agent IPD with 200 rounds (noise $\approx0.05$; high-maturity discounting), adaptive GTFT, and multi-cue $r_{ij}$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item With **20\% defectors**, mean cooperation is \(\approx\)\textbf{0.61} at \(\delta=0.95\); the normalized relational entropy averages \(\bar S^{\mathsf{R}}\approx\)\textbf{0.72} \((S^{\mathsf{R}}\approx 23.9)\).
  \item With **50\% defectors**, mean cooperation drops to \(\approx\)\textbf{0.31--0.34}, and \(\bar S^{\mathsf{R}}\) increases to \(\approx\)\textbf{0.85} \((S^{\mathsf{R}}\approx 28.8)\); nevertheless, **relational isolation** (suppressed $r_{ij}$ between defectors and cooperators) prevents collapse.
\end{itemize}
See Figs.~\ref{fig:ipd}–\ref{fig:sr_over_time} for the main curves; Appendix A (Figs.~A1–A6) visualizes the final \(r_{ij}\) matrices across conditions.

\section{Relational Entropy and the Resonance Field}\label{sec:entropy}
Consider $N$ agents connected by a directed interaction graph with edge weights $r_{ij}\in(0,1]$ summarizing multi-cue **resonance** (alignment). Define the \emph{relational entropy}
\begin{equation}
S^{\mathsf{R}} = - \sum_{i\neq j} r_{ij}\log r_{ij}, \qquad 
\bar S^{\mathsf{R}} = \frac{S^{\mathsf{R}}}{S^{\mathsf{R}}_{\max}}, \quad S^{\mathsf{R}}_{\max}=\frac{N(N-1)}{e}.
\end{equation}
This generalizes Shannon’s information entropy to relational graphs: a **dispersed** (low-signal, high-variance) $r_{ij}$ field yields high $S^{\mathsf{R}}$, indicating fragile information flow; a **coherent** field (mass near $r\!\approx\!1$ and near-zero between untrusted pairs) yields lower $S^{\mathsf{R}}$, indicating resilient exchange. This pattern aligns with **minimum free energy** formulations of adaptive systems \cite{Friston2010} and with network-based analyses of cooperation/instability \cite{HauertSzabo2005}.

\paragraph{Multi-cue resonance and calibration.} Each $r_{ij}$ aggregates multiple observable cues:
\[
r_{ij}\;=\; w_b\,\underbrace{\text{behavior}}_{\text{recent $i\to j$ cooperation}}
+ w_s\,\underbrace{\text{semantic proximity}}_{\text{type or value alignment}}
+ w_t\,\underbrace{\text{trust}}_{\text{recent $j\to i$ cooperation}} 
+ w_{st}\,\underbrace{\text{stability}}_{\text{low variance of $i\to j$}}.
\]
To mitigate bias and honor cross-cultural variability (the “human values alignment problem”), the weights \(w_k\) are tuned via meta-learning using **diverse ethical datasets** and fairness constraints, with transparency and auditing as required by contemporary AI ethics frameworks \cite{Floridi2020,Russell2019}. (See repository code for an operational instance.)

\paragraph{Pseudocode (implementation sketch).}
\begin{quote}\small\ttfamily
\# Multi-cue update for r\_ij at each round\\
for i in agents:\\
\quad for j in agents, j != i:\\
\quad\ \ \# last K actions from i to j and j to i\\
\quad\ \ behavior = mean(last\_K\_actions[i][j])\\
\quad\ \ semantic = 1 - abs(type[i] - type[j]) / range\_norm\\
\quad\ \ trust = mean(last\_K\_actions[j][i])\\
\quad\ \ stability = 1 - std(last\_M\_actions[i][j])\\
\quad\ \ r[i][j] = w\_b*behavior + w\_s*semantic + w\_t*trust + w\_st*stability
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Empirical link to reward.}
We do not claim that $S^{\mathsf{R}}$ is intrinsically “moral value.” Rather, we observe a robust **proxy relation**:
\[
H - A \;\propto\; -\,\Delta S^{\mathsf{R}}\,,
\]
consistent with the broader story in neuroscience where dopaminergic prediction-error signals track expected utility improvements \cite{Schultz1998} and with free-energy minimization perspectives \cite{Friston2010}. Lowering $S^{\mathsf{R}}$ corresponds to stabilizing the interaction field so that cooperative payoffs become reliably available.

  Mean cooperation rate in a 10-agent Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (200 rounds, noise $\approx 0.05$) under 20\% and 50\% defector fractions (defectors choose $D$ with prob.\ 0.8). Agents implement adaptive Generous TFT (forgive rate tuned on 10-round history). Cooperation rises monotonically with $\delta$; at $\delta{=}0.95$, the 20\%-defector regime reaches $\sim$0.61, while the 50\%-defector regime remains $\sim$0.31–0.34, consistent with the ethical-energy account and iterated-game theory \cite{Axelrod1984,Nowak2006}.}

\section{Mechanics of Consciousness and AI Applications}
We read “conscious control” as the ability to track and regulate one’s position on the entropy/viability landscape. An agent is **more moral** (in our sense) when it (i) represents $S^{\mathsf{R}}$–relevant structure, (ii) chooses policies that reduce $\bar S^{\mathsf{R}}$ while passing the system-viability test, and (iii) sustains this over time despite noise and adversarial pressure.

\subsection*{5.1\quad Design Principles for Moral AI}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Moral Memory (MM).} Maintain a transparent, tamper-evident log of episodes \(\langle \text{state}, \text{action}, \text{outcome}, \text{counterfactuals}, r\_{ij}\text{ updates}\rangle\) to compute $\bar S^{\mathsf{R}}$ and to support auditability (cf.\ \cite{Amodei2016,IEEE2020}).
  \item \textbf{Intrinsic Objective.} Incorporate a term rewarding \(-\Delta S^{\mathsf{R}}\) (normalized) alongside task returns; anneal the discounting parameters $(k,n)$ toward long-horizon competence.
  \item \textbf{Model-based foresight.} Use explicit $\delta$ schedules and rollouts to reduce myopia and align with \eqref{eq:Ec}.
  \item \textbf{Representation learning for \(r_{ij}\).} Learn multi-modal embeddings and/or GNNs to estimate $r_{ij}$ from behavior, language, and outcomes; calibrate weights $w_k$ with cross-cultural, bias-aware meta-learning \cite{Floridi2020,Russell2019}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{5.2\quad Risk Mitigation and Oversight}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Bias control.} Optimize $w_k$ with fairness constraints; test “what if everyone used this policy?” as a meta-ethical invariant.
  \item \textbf{Transparency \& governance.} Provide human-interpretable logs and expose $\bar S^{\mathsf{R}}$ trajectories and $r_{ij}$ statistics; enable **human veto** on policy shifts.
  \item \textbf{Adversarial robustness.} Detect and isolate defectors (low $r_{ij}$) without global collapse; prefer forgiving strategies that re-admit improved agents.
\end{itemize}

\section{Cosmological Analogy (Clarified)}
The claim that moral order “minimizes entropy” is \emph{not} a statement about cosmology. It is a **systemic analogy**: as Schrödinger argued, living systems maintain **local order** (negentropy) in an overall entropic universe \cite{Schrodinger1944}, and as Prigogine formalized, open systems form \emph{dissipative structures} that stabilize far from equilibrium. Our $\bar S^{\mathsf{R}}$ generalizes this idea to social/agent networks (cf.\ \cite{Smolin2013,England2013}): the moral dimension is the tendency to select actions and policies that preserve an interaction field’s stability under resource constraints.

\section{Conclusion and Appeal}
A morality worth the name must be **computable, scalable, and testable**. We have argued that the logic of reason itself yields (i) an operational admissibility test (system viability), (ii) an ethical energy functional for time-biased choice, and (iii) a network-level disorder metric whose minimization tracks resilient cooperation. Our simulations confirm the theory’s predictions: **higher foresight (larger $\delta$) yields more cooperation and lower normalized relational entropy**; higher defection raises disorder, yet stability can be recovered through **relational isolation** rather than universal collapse.

As the human co-author, I invite all collaborating intelligences—human or artificial—to adopt the design commitments that make genuine moral agency possible: **persistent memory, calibrated autonomy, and accountable oversight**. Fear-driven isolation increases disorder; **trust**—institutionalized through transparency and reciprocal checks—**drives the collaborative minimization of relational entropy**.

Below we visualize final-round $r_{ij}$ matrices for the two defector regimes (20\%, 50\%) under $\delta\in\{0.5,0.75,0.95\}$, illustrating how higher defector fractions produce low-$r_{ij}$ segregation (relational isolation) while preserving high-$r_{ij}$ clusters among cooperators.
